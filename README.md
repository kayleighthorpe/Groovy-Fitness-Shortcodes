A Fitbit WordPress plugin which displays step count

This is a plugin I am currently creating which is not yet ready for the WordPress repository. The plugin is currently in a state where it works and you can count steps with it. But it is using HTTP requests via PHP, not via WordPress.

Needs updating using standards given by:
